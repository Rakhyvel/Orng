- [x] immutability checking
- [x] Redo symbol versions, should probably just be symbols
- [x] rewrite [op]= assignments
- [x] Comparison operators should not be chainable
- [x] Parens (and only parens) should be one 'line', like in Python

- [x] Make modulo not chainable (perhaps even replace it with `mod` and `rem` prelude functions)

- [x] Allow trailing commas in parenthesis (`, nl )` => `nl )`)
- [x] Create a builtin module which contains info about builtin types
    - [x] Grep for every instance of `Int8` or something, extract that info to a file

- [x] In import graph, 1.5 <= (E+1)/N <= 4.0
- [x] look into `Walk.zig` from ziglang, seems like a pretty good way to walk over an AST
    - rewrite `ast` to be like IR
- [x] Write a python script to look for duplicate code!
- [x] Error if non-unit/non-void expression in block that isn't the final expression (this must be discarded, discards are unit typed)
- [x] Figure out how to do lints before GCC does
- [ ] Deduplication
- [ ] AST walker struct
- [ ] Go through MISRA when writing reqs
- [ ] Omitting a `->` in a function defaults to return type to be unit
- [ ] go through and see if parameters are needed, or if their select-children can be taken instead
- [ ] go through anywhere `unreachable` is used, and replace with a descriptive panic, prepend message with `compiler error: `
- [ ] bring back `const` as an introducer, remove it as a pattern

### Testing
- [x] test.orng should detect which folders are in tests/integration, and create those folders in tests/integration/build, rather than it being hard-coded.
- [x] find out if GCC supports UBSan! enable it
- [x] allow more than one command line argument
- [x] `count` command which just counts the number of .orng files
- [x] Enable coverage for subdirectories of integration
- [ ] Give a list of the tests that failed after a run
- [ ] Print integration test results after the tests are run, so it takes less time
- [ ] Negative tests should be in folders according to the kind of error, fail if other error than the expected
- [ ] Log manager, which takes in list of names from cmd line, only emits logs if the filename is in the list
- [ ] Automate a way to cycle through problems.txt, when it runs into one that crashes, have it automatically create a regressions file
- [ ] When a test fails, keep track of which test it was and how many times it's failed

### In-House rdgen
- [ ] Written in Zig
- [ ] Parses an LL(1) grammar
- [ ] Rejects if grammar is not LL(1) ("ambiguity" but not exactly)
- [ ] Generates JSON files of example programs, with identifiers, numbers, etc replaced with random values
- [ ] Supports including other ebnf files
- [ ] Multiply all possible paths, barring recursion, through grammar, give that number and use it for fuzz testing metrics
- [ ] Accepts escape sequences

- [ ] build system (built upon compile-time evaluation) 
    > **!IMPORTANT!** Should output .c and .h pair for each .orng file. Track dependencies, and only run CC on modified files and the files that depend* on modified files, to produce .o files which should be linked.
    > Projects are made up of packages are made up of modules. Projects have a `build.orng`.
    - [ ] compile phase
        - [ ] locate `build.orng`
        - [ ] compile `build.orng` file into a module
    - [ ] build phase
        - [ ] Setup a `Builder` object, which represents a DAG of goals (ie compiling an executable), and steps that achieve those goals
        - [ ] Pass the Builder (along with cmd line args) to `build()` in `build.orng`, interpret
        - [ ] `build()` fleshes out the DAG
            - [ ] executables have build modes like (debug | release), (executable | static library | dynamic library)
                - [ ] **IMPORTANT** indexes need to make their lhs lvalues in IR iff debug mode is off
            - [ ] be able to include C source files
            - [ ] be able to specify C header directories
            - [ ] be able to link static libraries
            - [ ] be able to link dynamic libraries
            - [ ] freestanding programs
    - [ ] make phase
        - [ ] Directed by the Builder object, and by the target specified by the cmd line args, execute the steps
    - [ ] `pub` keyword
    - [ ] `[pub] import qualified-name`, `[pub] using qualified-name` keywords
        > Packages are directories with a `build.orng` file (and likely either a `main.orng` or `root.orng` file)
        > Modules are either `.orng` files, or directories with a `root.orng` file, that conventionally imports/uses other modules in it's directory
        > Importing/Using namespaces begin either locally in the immediate directory, or with the dependencies added in the packages `build.orng`
        - [ ] `Builder::add_dependency`, which can take either an absolute, relative, or git input
    - [ ] `::` for module access
    - [ ] `@filename()`, `@line()`, `@fn_name()`
    - [ ] `test` to do tests
        > Rework integration tests
    - [ ] `fn main(sys: System)->!()`
        > System contains:
            - args: []String // the command line args
            - stdin: dyn Reader
            - stdout: dyn Writer
            - stderr: dyn Writer
            - global_allocator: dyn Allocator
            - fs: // File System?
            - net: // Socket system?
            - env: // How should environment variables work?
    > How do externs work?
    - [ ] random trait stuff now
        - [ ] Cannot impl an empty trait for primitives!
        - [ ] If T isn't null, either T or X must be defined in the same module
        - [ ] If T is null, X must be defined in the same module
- [ ] refinement types
    > This feature may not be needed, or good
    - [ ] `where` which checks at runtime if a condition is true, panics if it's not
    - [ ] `==>` implies boolean operator might be handy
        > `a ==> b` == `(not a) or b`
        > this is just sorta useful in general, even without refinements, which might not be as useful actually
        > `debug::assert(ast^ == .sum_value ==> ast_type^ == .sum_type)` <- very concise, readable, useful!
        > `ast^ == .match ==> mappings_have_rhs(ast)` <- short-circuits exactly like `(not a) or b`, (which isn't actually all that useful because rhs has to eval to a bool...)
    - [ ] `where comptime` checks a condition at compiletime. If a condition is false at compile-time, error
- [ ] type reflection
    - [ ] `@type_info()` and `@Type_Info()`, which give and are type reflection respectively
    - [ ] `@insert()`, which takes a comptime string and returns comptime AST structure

### Maybe Pile
- [ ] `undefined` (does this break some optimization assumptions?)

### Language Server
- [ ] Highlighting
- [ ] Goto definition
- [ ] Show types when you hover
- [ ] Show types when they're inferred
- [ ] Show error messages
- [ ] Formatter
    - [ ] Takes in code and formats it
- [ ] Linter
    > Make as many of these errors as you can, no one pays attention to warnings
    - [ ] Warn if line is too long (140, after being whitespace stripped, not including comments, is excessive)
    - [ ] Warn about code such as `y, x = x, y` which is parsed as `y, (x = x), y`
        > Error when non-unit expressions are in the middle of a block?
    - [ ] Warn if identifier is not in the right style
    - [ ] Warn if identifier begins with `0` (not an octal, a decimal! use `0o` for octal)
- [ ] Documentation generator
    - [ ] `///` Comment blocks are documentation
    - [ ] `\<attribute>` to mark attributes
    - [ ] error if attributes aren't documented or if they are but aren't present in the function

### Wishlist
- [ ] Make matches have to be exhaustive over all product types too. Make it UB to not match. Don't return optional value for matches
    > Generate all possible values (treat Ints and Floats as unit)
    > Feed values to patterns in order (ignore {block} patterns). 
    > If a pattern accepts, mark pattern, next value. 
    > If no patterns accept, value is witness of a value not matched by match, emit error.
    > After, if a pattern is not marked, it is a useless pattern, emit error.
    > Just not sure on the details. How are values represented? How are they generated? How are they accepted?
    > There's a better way to do this with matrices, but I didn't understand the papers.
